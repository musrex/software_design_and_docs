# Software Design & Documentation  

**Course Description:** This	course	introduces	the	student	to	the	software	development	lifecycle	at	
the	graduate	level.	Focus	will	be	placed	on	design	and	documentation	methodologies	used	by	
practitioners.	Students	will	learn	to	author	clear	and	effective	software	documentation	for	a	host	of	
different	design	methodologies.	Software	design	methodologies	discussed	will	include:	waterfall,	
spiral,	scrum,	and	agile.	Other	topics	include	version	control,	issue	tracking,	software	project	
management,	debugging,	and	profiling.  
  
**Course	Objectives:**	At	the	completion	of	this	course,	students	should	be	able	to	
1. use	automatic	code	documentation	tools	as	PythonDocs.
2. translate	algorithms	into	Java	language	and	document	it	using	JavaDocs.
3. define	documentation	for	classes	using	JavaDocs.
4. use	JavaDocs	documentation	to	software	reuse.
5. identify	the	stages	of		the	Software	Development	Lifecycle.
6. use	version	control	and	issue	tracking	tools.
7. perform	software	debugging,	testing,	and	profiling	tasks.
8. differentiate	usual	software	design	methodologies.
